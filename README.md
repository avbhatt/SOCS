## Setup (for testing)
1. Clone the entire repository
2. Select the `manifest.json` file within the `plugin` folder as your source for testing Chrome extensions, or any file within the `plugin` folder for testing with Firefox add-ons (about:debugging). This should immediately open the side panel and also include an icon in the top of your browser that looks like two speech bubbles.
3. To set up the npm dependencies, type `npm install` from the root directory
4. Then, to set up the node server to test the chat functionality, type `node index.js` from the root directory as well
